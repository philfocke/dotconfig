## Shared
### Theme
- Darktheme: rose-pine
Looking for something that is a bit more gray
Maybe playing around with [lush](https://github.com/rktjmp/lush.nvim) to create my own.
-Lighttheme: currently Searching
### Keyboard
#### Corne
Currently using a Bluetooth Corne Split Keyboard with 42 Keys
//TO-DO ADD Picture
Layout: Based on QWERTY, with extra Layers for mouse Movement. -- I would like to completely get away from using a mouse.
### Terminal
- [nvim](https://neovim.io/)
 - I like vim more
### Applications
- Obsidian
 - I've started using Obsidian about 3 years ago
 - Would like to change, but i like the nvim Plugin and am stuck using it for the collection of 
 spaced repetition flashcards i've amassed over the years with [obsidian-spaced-repetition](https://github.com/st3v3nmw/obsidian-spaced-repetition)
 - Probably switching once i find a srr that's able to handle Markdown,Code and LaTeX.

## Mac
### Desktop Enviroment
- yabai
 - Recently swapped from aerospace because of the implementation of scratchpads. I like the Syntax of aerospace more
- skhd
### Terminal
- [https://wezterm.org/index.html](Wezterm)
 - I would like to permanently change to Ghostty, but the way yabai implements scratchpad spaces at the moment means I have to use 2 terminal emulators. One that is only used for my current markdown note.

## Linux
### Desktop Enviroment
- [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/)
 - I've set up a mnemonics-based Space System, based on 
 an old i3 Setup.
 - I  don't like to use an application to display bar Elements, they feel distracting and waste space. 
 I don't need to always see what Song is currently playing while focusing!
 - [tofi](https://github.com/philj56/tofi)
  - Small menu to start my Applications.
  - Would like to get something thats as simple as this for my mac too.

### Terminal
- [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/)
 - Pretty much the default Configuration with Font and Theme Changes
- [Starship](https://starship.rs/)
- vim
 - For quick changes and programming I still use vim. I don't enjoy the heftiness of nvim with plugins if I don't need to. Using both is the current
 Middleground
- nvim
 - For larger Projects, still a quite small configuration based on [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) mostle for Java Projects and taking Markdown Notes
